3403. Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box I

You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.

Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

word is split into numFriends non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
All the split words are put into a box.
Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "dbca", numFriends = 2

Output: "dbc"

Explanation: 

All possible splits are:

"d" and "bca".
"db" and "ca".
"dbc" and "a".
Example 2:

Input: word = "gggg", numFriends = 4

Output: "g"

Explanation: 

The only possible split is: "g", "g", "g", and "g".

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 5 * 103
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= numFriends <= word.length

his problem asks us to find the lexicographically largest string among all possible substrings generated by splitting a given word into numFriends non-empty parts across multiple rounds. The key constraint is that no previous round can have the exact same split.

Let's break down the problem, the provided code, and then walk through an example.

Problem Explanation
You are given:

word: A string of lowercase English letters.
numFriends: An integer representing the number of friends playing the game.
The game proceeds in rounds. In each round:

The word is split into numFriends non-empty substrings.
The crucial rule is that a split configuration (i.e., the set of numFriends substrings) cannot be repeated in subsequent rounds.
All the substrings generated from these splits (across all possible non-repeated splits) are put into a "box."
Your goal is to find the lexicographically largest string among all the strings in the box.

Lexicographical Comparison:
Recall that lexicographical comparison is similar to dictionary order. For strings A and B:

If A is a prefix of B, then A<B (e.g., "apple" < "applepie").
If they differ at the first position, the string with the smaller character at that position is lexicographically smaller (e.g., "cat" < "dog").
If they are identical, they are equal.
Example 1: word = "dbca", numFriends = 2

Possible splits (each representing a round):

"d" and "bca" -> strings in box: "d", "bca"
"db" and "ca" -> strings in box: "d", "bca", "db", "ca"
"dbc" and "a" -> strings in box: "d", "bca", "db", "ca", "dbc", "a"
After all rounds, the strings in the box are: "d", "bca", "db", "ca", "dbc", "a".
The lexicographically largest among these is "dbc".

        :type word: str
        :type numFriends: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        # Base case: If there's only one friend, the only split is the word itself.

            return word

        n = len(word)
        # The maximum possible length of a substring that can be formed
        # when splitting into numFriends parts.
        # If we split into numFriends parts, and each of the first numFriends-1
        # parts has a length of at least 1, then the last part can have
        # a maximum length of n - (numFriends - 1) = n - numFriends + 1.
        # Any string longer than this cannot be formed.
        length = n - numFriends + 1

        # as a lexicographically larger string must start with a lexicographically
        # larger character or be longer if the starting characters are the same.
        for i in range(n):
            if word[i] == max_char:
                # Form a substring of the calculated maximum possible length,
                # starting from the current index i.
                substr = word[i:i + length]
                
                # Update the result if the current substring is lexicographically larger.
                # If 'substr' is shorter than 'length' (which happens if i + length > n),
                # it means this substring is a suffix of the original word.
                # The 'max' function handles the comparison correctly.
                result = max(result, substr)

        return result
Reasoning Behind the Approach:

The core insight here is related to lexicographical comparison. To find the lexicographically largest string, we want a string that:

Starts with the largest possible character.
If multiple strings start with the largest character, we want the one that is longest among them (or has the lexicographically largest subsequent characters).
Consider the constraint: "word is split into numFriends non-empty strings".
If we split word into P_1, P_2, ..., P_{numFriends}, where each P 
j
​
  is non-empty, then the minimum length of any P 
j
​
  is 1.
The maximum length of any single part P 
j
​
  would occur when the other numFriends - 1 parts are all of length 1.
Thus, the maximum possible length for any single substring in a valid split is len(word) - (numFriends - 1), which simplifies to len(word) - numFriends + 1.

The code leverages this:

It calculates length = n - numFriends + 1, which is the maximum possible length any substring can have in any valid split.
It finds max_char, the largest character in word.
It then iterates through word. If word[i] is max_char, it considers the substring word[i : i + length].
Why just these substrings? Because any lexicographically largest string must start with max_char (unless all characters are the same, in which case it doesn't matter). If a string starts with a character smaller than max_char, it cannot be the lexicographically largest string.
Why only consider up to length? Because any substring longer than length cannot be formed as part of a valid split. If word[i:i+length] goes beyond the end of the word (i.e., i + length > n), then word[i:n] (the suffix starting at i) is considered. This is correct because if word[i:n] is a valid substring that can be formed, it's a candidate.
By taking max(result, substr), it effectively finds the lexicographically largest string among all substrings that start with max_char and have a length up to length.
The crucial part here is that we don't actually need to simulate all possible splits. The problem asks for the lexicographically largest string from the box. Since any non-empty substring of length up to n - numFriends + 1 could potentially be one of the numFriends parts in some valid split (by making the other numFriends - 1 parts length 1), we just need to find the overall lexicographically largest among these candidates. The constraint about "no previous round has had the exact same split" only ensures that all possible unique splits are considered, which in turn means all possible valid substrings eventually end up in the box.

Detailed Walkthrough with Example
Let's use word = "dbca", numFriends = 2.

Initialization:

numFriends is 2, which is not 1, so we proceed.
n = len(word) = 4
length = n - numFriends + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3
This means the maximum length of any part in a split of "dbca" into 2 parts is 3.
Example splits: "d" + "bca" (length 1 and 3), "db" + "ca" (length 2 and 2), "dbc" + "a" (length 3 and 1). All parts are length ≤3.
max_char = max("dbca") = 'd'
result = ""
Loop through word (from i = 0 to n-1):

i = 0:

word[0] is 'd'.
word[0] == max_char ('d' == 'd') is True.
substr = word[0 : 0 + length] = word[0 : 3] = "dbc"
result = max("", "dbc") = "dbc"
(Current largest is "dbc")
i = 1:

word[1] is 'b'.
word[1] == max_char ('b' == 'd') is False.
(Skip this i, as 'b' cannot be the start of the lexicographically largest string if 'd' exists)
i = 2:

word[2] is 'c'.
word[2] == max_char ('c' == 'd') is False.
(Skip this i)
i = 3:

word[3] is 'a'.
word[3] == max_char ('a' == 'd') is False.
(Skip this i)
End of loop.

Return result:

The function returns "dbc".
This matches the example output.

Let's consider another case: word = "apple", numFriends = 3

Initialization:

numFriends is 3, not 1.
n = len("apple") = 5
length = n - numFriends + 1 = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3
Maximum length of any part is 3. For example, "a", "pp", "le" (lengths 1, 2, 2). "app", "l", "e" (lengths 3, 1, 1).
max_char = max("apple") = 'p'
result = ""
Loop through word:

i = 0: word[0] is 'a'. Not 'p'. Skip.
i = 1:
word[1] is 'p'. word[1] == max_char is True.
substr = word[1 : 1 + length] = word[1 : 4] = "ppl"
result = max("", "ppl") = "ppl"
i = 2:
word[2] is 'p'. word[2] == max_char is True.
substr = word[2 : 2 + length] = word[2 : 5] = "ple"
result = max("ppl", "ple") = "ppl" (because 'p' == 'p', 'p' > 'l')
i = 3: word[3] is 'l'. Not 'p'. Skip.
i = 4: word[4] is 'e'. Not 'p'. Skip.
End of loop.

Return result: "ppl"

This approach is efficient because it avoids generating all possible splits, which can be computationally expensive. Instead, it directly targets the properties of the lexicographically largest string: 
it must start with the largest available character and be as long as possible (up to the maximum permissible length).
