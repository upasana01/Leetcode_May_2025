"""3445. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency II

You are given a string s and an integer k. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters, freq[a] - freq[b], in a substring subs of s, such that:

subs has a size of at least k.
Character a has an odd frequency in subs.
Character b has an even frequency in subs.
Return the maximum difference.

Note that subs can contain more than 2 distinct characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "12233", k = 4

Output: -1

Explanation:

For the substring "12233", the frequency of '1' is 1 and the frequency of '3' is 2. The difference is 1 - 2 = -1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "1122211", k = 3

Output: 1

Explanation:

For the substring "11222", the frequency of '2' is 3 and the frequency of '1' is 2. The difference is 3 - 2 = 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "110", k = 3

Output: -1

 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
s consists only of digits '0' to '4'.
The input is generated that at least one substring has a character with an even frequency and a character with an odd frequency.
1 <= k <= s.length
"""

"""

This problem asks us to find the maximum possible difference between the frequency of two characters,
freq[a] - freq[b], within any substring subs of a given string s. There are two crucial conditions for this substring:

Length: The substring subs must have a length of at least k.
Frequency Parity: Character a must have an odd frequency within subs, and character b must have an even frequency within subs.
We need to consider all possible pairs of distinct characters (a, b) and all valid substrings to find the maximum difference.

Let's break down the provided Python code step by step.

Problem Explanation
The core idea is to iterate through all possible substrings that meet the length requirement and then, for each substring,
check all pairs of characters (a, b) to see if they satisfy the odd/even frequency conditions. However, a naive approach of checking every substring and every character pair would be too slow (O(N 
3
 â‹…C 
2
 ), where C is the number of distinct characters).

The provided solution uses a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums for efficient frequency calculation.
The maxDfromAtoB function is designed to find the maximum difference for a fixed pair of characters (a, b). The maxDifference function then iterates through all possible (a, b) pairs and calls maxDfromAtoB.

Code Explanation
maxDifference(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
Initialization:
n = len(s): Stores the length of the input string s.
freq = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(5)]: This is a 2D list used for storing prefix frequencies. freq[d][i] will store the count of digit d in the substring s[0...i-1]. 
The size is 5 because the problem statement doesn't specify character set beyond examples using digits '0'-'3', so it's a reasonable assumption for the given constraints. 
If the input string could contain a wider range of characters, this would need to be 26 for lowercase letters or more for ASCII/Unicode.
conter = Counter(s): This line seems to be a remnant or not directly used in the final logic for calculating frequencies within substrings, as the freq prefix sum array handles this.
Prefix Frequency Calculation:
The nested loops populate the freq array.
for i in range(n):: Iterates through each character in s.
for d in range(5):: For each character position i, it copies the previous prefix sum for all digits d.
freq[int(s[i])][i + 1] += 1: Increments the count for the current character s[i] at the i+1 position in its respective digit's frequency array.
Finding Maximum Difference:
ans = float('-inf'): Initializes the maximum difference to negative infinity.
for a in range(5):: Outer loop iterates through all possible characters a (0-4).
if freq[a][n] == 0:: If character a doesn't appear in the entire string s, it can't be a character with odd frequency, so skip it.
for b in range(5):: Inner loop iterates through all possible characters b (0-4).
if a == b or freq[b][n] == 0:: Skip if a and b are the same character (problem states "two characters") or if b doesn't appear in s.
ans = max(ans, self.maxDfromAtoB(a, b, k, n, freq)): Calls maxDfromAtoB for the current pair (a, b) and updates ans with the maximum.
Return: Returns the ans which holds the overall maximum difference.
maxDfromAtoB(self, a: int, b: int, k: int, n: int, freq: List[List[int]]) -> int:
This function takes the specific characters a and b, the minimum length k, the string length n, and the prefix frequency array freq as input. It aims to find the maximum freq[a] - freq[b] for the given a and b that satisfy the parity conditions.

Initialization:

cnt = float('-inf'): Stores the maximum difference found for the current (a, b) pair.
MOD = 10 ** 8: This variable is not used in the provided code logic. It might be a leftover from a different problem or a template.
minFreq = [[MOD, MOD], [MOD, MOD]]: This 2D array is the core of the optimization. It stores the minimum prevA - prevB encountered for a given parity combination of prevA and prevB.
minFreq[0][0]: Stores min prevA - prevB where prevA is even and prevB is even.
minFreq[0][1]: Stores min prevA - prevB where prevA is even and prevB is odd.
minFreq[1][0]: Stores min prevA - prevB where prevA is odd and prevB is even.
minFreq[1][1]: Stores min prevA - prevB where prevA is odd and prevB is odd.
Initialized to MOD (a large value) to ensure min operations work correctly.
freqA = 0, freqB = 0: Current frequencies of a and b in the sliding window.
prevA = 0, prevB = 0: Frequencies of a and b in the prefix ending at l-1.
l = 0: Left pointer of the sliding window.
Sliding Window:

for r in range(k - 1, n):: The r (right) pointer iterates from k-1 to n-1. This ensures the initial window size is at least k.

freqA = freq[a][r + 1]: Frequency of a in s[0...r].

freqB = freq[b][r + 1]: Frequency of b in s[0...r].

Window Adjustment and Minimum Difference Tracking:

while r - l + 1 >= k and freqB - prevB >= 2:: This while loop is crucial and seems to have a logical issue or a very specific intention. Let's analyze its parts:

r - l + 1 >= k: Ensures the current window s[l...r] is at least k in length.

freqB - prevB >= 2: This condition is problematic. freqB is the count of b in s[0...r], and prevB is the count of b in s[0...l-1]. So freqB - prevB is the count of b in s[l...r]. This condition means "the count of b in the current window is at least 2". This is not how a sliding window usually works for frequency differences. It seems designed to shrink the window only if b has appeared at least twice in the current window. This could lead to incorrect window shrinking behavior and not cover all valid substrings.

Intended Logic (Based on typical sliding window for frequency problems): The general approach for fixed character pairs is to iterate r, then update window frequencies. Then, if the window length r - l + 1 >= k, calculate freqA_in_window - freqB_in_window. The minFreq array is usually used to optimize the search for the best l given r.

Current while loop behavior:

minFreq[prevA & 1][prevB & 1] = min(minFreq[prevA & 1][prevB & 1], prevA - prevB): This line updates minFreq based on the frequencies up to the previous l position. It stores prevA - prevB, which represents the difference in frequencies in the prefix s[0...l-1].
prevA = freq[a][l + 1]: Updates prevA to the frequency of a up to s[l].
prevB = freq[b][l + 1]: Updates prevB to the frequency of b up to s[l].
l += 1: Shrinks the window from the left.
Re-evaluation of the while loop logic: The current implementation of while r - l + 1 >= k and freqB - prevB >= 2 is highly suspicious.
freqB - prevB is the frequency of 'b' in the current window s[l...r]. The loop condition freqB - prevB >= 2 makes it such that the while loop only proceeds if the frequency of 'b' in the current window is at least 2. This is not the standard way to maintain a sliding window for finding maximums or minimums, especially when dealing with parity conditions.

Let's assume the problem intends to find the max difference for any substring meeting criteria. A more typical sliding window approach would be:

Expand window by r.
Update freqA_curr_window = freq[a][r+1] - freq[a][l] and freqB_curr_window = freq[b][r+1] - freq[b][l].
If freqA_curr_window is odd and freqB_curr_window is even, and r - l + 1 >= k, then update cnt = max(cnt, freqA_curr_window - freqB_curr_window).
Optionally, slide l if some constraint is violated or to find optimal l.
The minFreq array is used to find the best prevA - prevB such that when freqA - prevA (which is freqA_in_window) is odd and freqB - prevB (which is freqB_in_window) is even, the overall freqA_in_window - freqB_in_window is maximized. This means we are looking for (freqA - prevA) - (freqB - prevB) = (freqA - freqB) - (prevA - prevB). To maximize this, we need to maximize freqA - freqB and minimize prevA - prevB.

Calculating cnt:

cnt = max(cnt, freqA - freqB - minFreq[1 - (freqA & 1)][freqB & 1])
Here, freqA and freqB are the prefix frequencies up to r.
(freqA & 1) gives the parity of freqA (0 for even, 1 for odd).
1 - (freqA & 1): If freqA is odd, we need prevA to be even for freqA_in_window = freqA - prevA to be odd. So we look at minFreq[0][...]. If freqA is even, we need prevA to be odd for freqA_in_window to be odd. So we look at minFreq[1][...].
freqB & 1: If freqB is even, we need prevB to be even for freqB_in_window = freqB - prevB to be even. So we look at minFreq[...][0]. If freqB is odd, we need prevB to be odd for freqB_in_window to be even. So we look at minFreq[...][1].
Thus, minFreq[1 - (freqA & 1)][freqB & 1] retrieves the minimum (prevA - prevB) that ensures (freqA - prevA) is odd and (freqB - prevB) is even.
If minFreq[...] is still MOD, it means no such l has been found yet that satisfies the parity requirements for the prefix s[0...l-1], so we can't form a valid (a,b) pair satisfying the parity conditions for the current window s[l...r] ending at r. The max operation will naturally handle MOD returning cnt.
Final while loop check:
The while r - l + 1 >= k and freqB - prevB >= 2: seems to be used to update minFreq values only when the substring length is sufficient and freqB has a certain minimum count in the current window. This might be trying to optimize something, but it deviates from a standard sliding window approach and could miss valid substrings. A more robust way to handle minFreq updates is to update minFreq for every possible l after r - l + 1 >= k check, and then calculate cnt.

Let's rethink the maxDfromAtoB function, as the provided code's sliding window part is unusual. The problem asks for any substring of length at least k. This usually points to a two-pointer approach where r expands and l expands to maintain conditions.

Revised conceptual approach for maxDfromAtoB (assuming the minFreq logic is key):

For a fixed a and b:
We want to maximize (count_a_in_subs - count_b_in_subs).
Let count_a_in_subs = freq[a][r+1] - freq[a][l]
Let count_b_in_subs = freq[b][r+1] - freq[b][l]

We need (freq[a][r+1] - freq[a][l]) % 2 == 1
And (freq[b][r+1] - freq[b][l]) % 2 == 0

This means:
freq[a][r+1] % 2 != freq[a][l] % 2 (i.e., one is odd, one is even)
freq[b][r+1] % 2 == freq[b][l] % 2 (i.e., both are odd or both are even)

We are maximizing (freq[a][r+1] - freq[b][r+1]) - (freq[a][l] - freq[b][l]).
Let diff_prefix[i] = freq[a][i] - freq[b][i].
We are maximizing diff_prefix[r+1] - diff_prefix[l].
This is a classic "find max(val_at_r - val_at_l) where r and l satisfy conditions" problem.
For each r (from k-1 to n-1):

Calculate freqA_at_r = freq[a][r+1] and freqB_at_r = freq[b][r+1].
We need to find the minimum diff_prefix[l] (i.e., freq[a][l] - freq[b][l]) for a valid l such that r - l + 1 >= k and the parity conditions are met.
Condition for a: freqA_at_r and freqA_at_l must have different parities.
Condition for b: freqB_at_r and freqB_at_l must have the same parities.
We maintain a min_prefix_diff[parity_a][parity_b] array, where parity_a = freq[a][l] % 2 and parity_b = freq[b][l] % 2.
For the current r, we would look up min_prefix_diff[ (freqA_at_r + 1) % 2 ][ freqB_at_r % 2 ]. This represents the minimum freq[a][l] - freq[b][l] such that freq[a][l] has opposite parity to freqA_at_r and freq[b][l] has same parity as freqB_at_r.
After processing r, we update min_prefix_diff[freqA_at_r % 2][freqB_at_r % 2] with min(current_value, freqA_at_r - freqB_at_r). This update should happen only after the window size condition r - l + 1 >= k is met.
The provided while loop while r - l + 1 >= k and freqB - prevB >= 2: seems to be trying to manage when minFreq is updated, but the freqB - prevB >= 2 condition is problematic. It's not clear why it's there.

Let's assume the provided maxDfromAtoB logic is attempting a variation of this prefix difference minimization, even if the while loop condition is odd.

4. maxDifference continues:

ans is updated to max(current_ans, 1) which is max(-inf, 1) = 1.
The final ans returned by maxDifference will be 1. This matches Example 2.

The while r - l + 1 >= k and freqB - prevB >= 2: condition is definitely unusual.
It seems to be trying to find a starting point l such that the characters within the window s[l...r] fulfill some condition related to freqB's count, and only then update minFreq for the prefix s[0...l-1].
